## Problem Statement
Implement t-SNE
## Goals and Approach
Implement t-SNE
## Dataset
From t-SNE
## Expected Deliverables
t-SNE
## Rough timeline
1. 7 November - 12 November : Paper review
2. 12 November - 17 November : Testing standard implementations of the methond using pre-built libraries on given dataset, test on newer datasets
3. 17 November - 1 December : Implementation of t-SNE and testing with existing implementations

The above timeline is approximate and may change as the project progresses.

## Work distribution
1. Kunal Jain - paper review
2. Samay Kothari - paper review
3. Aaditya Sharma - paper review
4. Adwait Raste - paper review

The above will be updated accordingly as the project progresses.
